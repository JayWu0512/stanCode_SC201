# stanCode-SC201: Artificial Intelligence

## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

In Oct 2023, I decided to pursue a career in programming, exploring the integration between the fields of accounting and programming, and I am currently navigating this path.

## üìÜ My Journey

I have conquered SC001 and SC101 courses, giving me skills similar to what's taught in Stanford's CS106B. My educational quest continues with an exciting lineup in the courses of SC201: Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and NLP with Deep Learning. Stay tuned for updates on my learning milestones!
